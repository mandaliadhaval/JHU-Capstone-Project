Approach
========================================================

A body of [sample texts](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) consisting of ~4M documents including tweets, news articles and blog posts are loaded and exploratory analysis performed. Sets of n-grams are extracted from the corpus, predictive algororithms built, and various methods for improving predictive accuracy explored and refined.

Optimization
========================================================

* 4M to 1M document reduction via random sampling
* 1M documents transformed and reduced
* Iterative process of analysis, optimization and perf testing
* Document-term matrices generated with {1-5}-ngrams
* n-grams organized by frequency of occurrence in corpus
* Least common n-grams pruned/dropped for final model..
    * 18,936 words occurring more than 10x
    * 199,966 2-grams w/ frequency > 3x
    * 150,489 3-grams w/ frequency > 3x
    * 139,984 4-grams w/ frequency > 2x
    * 43,024 5-grams w/ frequency > 2x

Prediction Algorithm
========================================================

* Capture input text, including all preceding words in the phrase
* Iteratively traverse n-grams (longest to shortest) for matches
* On match(es), use the longest, most common, n-gram
* Last word in the matching n-gram is the predicted next word
* If no match in {5, 4, 3, 2}-grams, resort to randomly selecting a most frequently occurring 1-gram (e.g. common word)

Application
========================================================

[Text-Predictor-App](https://mandaliadhaval.shinyapps.io/Word_Predictor_App/)
interactively performs word/phrase completion!

Glossary
========================================================
## Performance
* **15%** Accuracy (using only first, top-ranked response)
* **22%** Accuracy (selecting from top-5 ranked responses)
* Mean Response Time: **250ms**
* Memory: **9MB** compressed, **104MB** in-memory
